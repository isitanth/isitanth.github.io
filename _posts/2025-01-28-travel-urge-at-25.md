## The pressure that builds

There's a pressure that builds when you're in your twenties and entering your own life for the first time. Not your parents' life, not the track that was laid out, *yours*. It sounds like freedom (somehow), and it is, but freedom has weight. You feel alone in a way that's hard to articulate. The walls of your apartment know you too well. The loops repeat. You don't know where you have to go from here, welcome to the next level.

It really hurts when, after your graduation or whatever teenage/university time allowed you to have such a framework, with every semester a review of what you did and where you're going, suddenly it's over. Now that this structure is gone, I felt hurt in some way. Hurt in the freedom I embrace, hurt by being lost, hurt by the contrast between what you want, what you think, and what others expect.

So you leave (at least that's what I'm doing).

Not to run away, exactly. Or maybe yes, but also to run *toward*. To reset. To expand. All of these at once, tangled together in a single impulse: **I need to go away.**

## The paradox of "alone"

Here's what I didn't expect: the cure for feeling isolated at home was choosing, or rather embracing, solitude abroad.

Jordan. India. Peru. Transnistria. Moldova. Albania. Bulgaria. Malta. And many more.

Alone in places where I couldn't fall back on the familiar, where no one knew my name or my habits or my comfortable stories about myself.

And somehow, that aloneness felt completely different.

At home, isolation is a beautiful, bitter, golden cage: same walls, same mental loops, same pressure with no release valve. Abroad, solitude becomes a lens. You're not trapped with yourself anymore. You're finally *meeting* yourself, without all the usual furniture in the way.

The *comfort zone* doesn't disappear when you travel solo. You carry it with you. But every day, you have to step outside it just to eat breakfast, to ask directions, to exist. And then something shifts: you start asking locals who they are, what their stories hold, what matters to them. You take time. You listen, not to respond, but to understand. You become genuinely interested in the other person, and that genuine interest is felt.

Carnegie wrote that you can make more friends in two months by becoming interested in other people than you can in two years by trying to get other people interested in you. Travel taught me this isn't just social advice, it's a way of being. When you approach strangers with curiosity instead of agenda, something unexpected happens: they open up, they share, they remember you.

And something in that daily friction starts to recalibrate you. Because over time, you'll find this disinterested generosity toward others coming back to you without asking for anything. This form of *peace you were seeking?* It finds you.

## The only thing I know

I came back from these trips with one answer that settled deep:

**The only thing I truly know is that I know nothing.**

Socrates said it first. But there's a difference between intellectually agreeing with that statement and feeling it crack open inside you while standing in a government office, daily end user apps and systems in Transnistria, Moldova, India, realizing their IT systems, simple, functional, *implemented*, work somehow better than what I've seen in parts of modern countries.

We Europeans carry so many quiet prejudices. We assume "advanced" means us. We look at Eastern Europe, at developing nations, and we project backwardness without even noticing we're doing it.

Then you go there. You see solutions born from necessity, unencumbered by bureaucracy. You realize that sometimes being "behind" actually allows you to leapfrog.

I'm a solution architect by trade. I think in systems, constraints, trade-offs. Travel taught me that the best solutions don't always come from the places with the most resources, they come from the places with the most clarity about what actually needs to be solved.

## Same at the core

The surfaces are different everywhere. Language. Food. Rituals. The way people greet each other, argue, pray, rest.

But underneath, **we are remarkably the same**.

The same hopes. The same fears. The same tenderness with children, the same exhaustion at the end of a working day, the same laughter when something absurd happens.

Travel grows this lens. You stop seeing "the other" and start seeing mirrors. And somewhere in that recognition, you begin to understand yourself in ways that weren't available to you before.

## The return

You come back changed. That's the promise of travel, and it's true.

But here's what no one tells you: **the change creates new questions**.

You leave seeking answers and return carrying gaps you didn't know existed. The world got bigger, and now your old frameworks feel too small.

Maybe that's the real reason the urge keeps returning. Not because you haven't found what you're looking for, but because each journey reveals how much more there is to find.

## Go. Assess. Understand. Return.

No social media filter. No secondhand opinions from TV news. Just you, a place, and the slow work of seeing for yourself.

You'll come back with answers. You'll come back with more questions.

Both are the point.
